  <p>The Waterfall Lifecycle involves 6 steps, of which all follow a linear pattern. An old, but trialed method that has been used for years. Some merits are:
<li>A simple model to interpret</li>
<li>Easy judgement of progress</li>
</ul>
Some Disadvantages:
<ul>
<li>Lot's of documentation!!!</li>
<li>As the model is linear, if the requirements are not met the process bag steps a lot, which can be costly and time consuming</li>
<li>Users are not involved in the process until testing, which can affect the point above</li>
<li>Huge delay between start of the project and some prototyped code</li>
</p>
